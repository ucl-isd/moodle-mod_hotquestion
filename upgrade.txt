    are getting a grade anyway. 

=== 4.1.0 === 2022052100 release is pending
20220220 HotQuestion_484 - Need to update GDPR Code. Made changes as needed until
    the code ran without errors when I ran: php adhoc_task.php --execute. As of
    20220410 I have added comments so they need to be included in the GDPR Code.
20220410 Hot Question_838 - Need setting to limit new comments to the current round.
    Made changes to an if in results.php about line 328. Also had to change some
    code in lib.php at about line 494. See ticket for more details.

    Added modified code from contributed work into current Hot Question code.
20220427 Hot Question_848 - String [grade,core] is deprecated. 20220427 Changed
    the language string reference in hotquestion/classes/output/rankingtable.php
    down around line 144 from, get_string('grade'), over to, get_string('gradenoun'),
    and the debug error went away.
20220427 Hot Question_849 - get_extra_user_fields() is deprecated. Changed the code
    as needed to fix the problem. See the ticket for details.

    lib.php down around line 809.
20220427 Ran codechecker and fixed hundreds of warnings and errors, as needed.
20220502 Hot Question_854 - Need a space between new Rating score and Rating ranking
    button. In view.php down around line 255, I added an echo space that only gets
    added if the user can see the button. For a normal student user, the extra space
    is not needed as spacing is handled by the toolbar.
20220503 Hot Question_855 - Need heatgiven and heatreceived in place of Votes in
    Rating ranking. Added new $fields to the sql in ranking_tables.php file down
    around line 185 that counts the number of heat/votes that a user has received.
    Also added needed language string for heatreceived. Also changed the votes
    string to heatgiven.
20220504 Hot Question_856 - Need teacherpriority column on Rating ranking page. Added
    the needed code to the ranking_table.php file like I did yesterday for heatreceived.

    negative teacher priority count.
20220505 Hot Question_858 - Need to add percentage factors to column labels. Added
    needed info to the string for each column label. The way the ranking _table.php
    does this, it automatically gets added for downloads.

    Made code and language string changes as needed int eh language file and other
    locations.
20220507 Hot Question_860 - Need to change hard coded text to a language string in
    the /mod/hotquestion/classes/output/viewgrades.php file. Commented out the original
    line of code and changed to new version using a string. Have a second commented
    out version available, if needed.
20220507 Hot Question_861 - The ranking_table.php file name needs to be changed to
    viewgrades.php. Changed the filename and, hopefully, all references to it in
    all the Hot Question files.

    in grades.php file. Changed the $rankingtable variable to $gradestable. Hopefully,
    I have changed all references to it, also.
20220507 Hot Question_863 - Need to fix viewgrades.php functions that print out the
    column data. Tested each of the column functions and fixed code and reference name
    errors, as needed. Ensured the teacher priority prints '-' in the teacher priority
    column for students that have NOT posted a question, yet. Prints a 0 if they posted
    a question, but the teacher has NOT changed the priority.

    manual sort using copy and paste.

    changes. Still needs further testing but backup and restore is working.
20220502 Hot Question_839 - Need to make sure associated comments are deleted
    whenever a question is deleted. 20220510 1115 Added two lines of code and a comment
    to locallib.php.When a question is deleted, it, any comments on it, and any votes
    on it, are also deleted.
20220510 1130 Ran codechecker and made changes as needed.
20220519 1030 Hot Questions_868 - Group is not working correctly when going from view to
    grades. Noticed this problem back when I first integrated the contributed code. Just
    now spent a few minutes to actually add the $group information to the $url in
    view.php. Got a weird result (managers only) the very first time I went to grades.php
    page, but after that it seems to be working correctly.
